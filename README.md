# DM-Capstone
 DM Capstone Project, Matter (EE 4859/ART 4059)

For our Digital Media Capstone Project, our group decided to create a 2D Unity Metroidvania called Matter.
This project was a semester long undertaking that our group worked on, creating everything in the game from scratch,
including all art assets, scripts, level designs, UI, animation, etc.

The game files are included in the DM Capstone folder (DM-Capstone/DM Capstone) and a final Build is located in the Matter Build folder (DM-Capstone/Matter Build)

The group members that contributed and their main contributions are below:

-Adam Schwarzenbach (ART 4059) -  animate enemies, composed music, designed more UI

-Austin Carter (EE 4859) - general UI work/animation implementation/campfires

-Madison Manale (ART 4059) - animate player, animate boss, created other tilemap

-Robert Boese (EE 4859) -  Level design, pixel art (enemies/environment)

-Tristan Evans (EE 4859) - scripting/debugging/finalize enemy AI/sound design
